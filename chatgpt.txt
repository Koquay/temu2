In the following input I want to call the compareVerificationCodes function on every entry made by the userVerificationCode
without the user having to press enter. (change) requires the user to press enter;

<input
    class="form-control"
    type="text"
    name="verificationCode"
    [(ngModel)]="userVerificationCode"
    (change)="compareVerificationCodes()"
    />
